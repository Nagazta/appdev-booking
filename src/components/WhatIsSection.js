      <p>
      Wild Teach would enable students like Student A to book tutoring sessions with Student B, who specializes in that subject.  This way, 
      Student A can catch up on lessons, while Student B can earn and strengthen their knowledge through teaching.  Wild Teach benefits 
      both parties by keeping tutoring on-campus, saving time and effort and making it convenient for everyone.
